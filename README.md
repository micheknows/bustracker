# Real Time Bus Tracker

This project animate a marker along a bus route between MIT and Harvard, showing bus stops along the way. 

## Description 

When the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button is clicked, the marker will move between predetermined bus stop coordinates on the map at an interval of 1 second. The marker will move sequentially between the bus stop positions, simulating the bus route in real time.

## How to Run

Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to start the bus route animation.

## Roadmap

Future improvements for this project include:

- Using real-time GPS data to animate actual bus locations
- Adding more UI controls like pause, reset, speed adjustment
- Displaying bus schedule and arrival time information at stops
